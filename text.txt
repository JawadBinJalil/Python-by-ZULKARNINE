Fruits are part and parcel of our daily life as they are a major source of dietary nutrients. It is also important for preventing diseases like heart stroke, cancer, blood pressure and so on. On the other hand, fruits are also good producer of bacteria, fungi and so on.  It is also important to have fresh fruit. Addition to that, there are some fruits which is imported from foreign country. During export import fruits create a number of problems and the quality of food can be hampered during the packaging time because of perfect packaging.  So that it is very difficult to understand if the fruits are safe or not for consumers.Putting those problems in front of us, we have come with a new idea about fruit detection sensor. Our work is to detect the name of fruit and to detect the percentage of freshness of the fruit by using image processing and deep learning. By using this fruit detector general people will be able to see if the fruit is fresh or not. This machine will automatically detect the name of the fruit, current state of the fruit. It will verify the color, stains for the result. It will also help the mobile court offices to detect the freshness of fruit in a very short time.
